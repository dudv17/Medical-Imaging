# Medical Imaging: Pneumothorax Segmentation
This repository contains the project work for the course of "Medical Imaging" as part of the Master of Science program in Data Science at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca. 
The project focuses on the use of deep learning architectures for the segmentation of pneumothorax from a set of chest X-ray images (see [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview)
